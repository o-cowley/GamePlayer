# GamePlayer
This is a collection of a few small games that are written in Java and use Swing to create the visualizations. 
Right now the image of the rocketship for the space invaders game seems not to be accessible but I am working on that, 
it will stay as an oval until I can work out the file pathing.

None of the games have win states yet! Just a few levels or working game mechanics while I continue with school.
