This is a game that is loosely based on the Galaxy Quest games, there are multiple levels of alien density, which changes as you hit them and your score goes up,
and also bullet spread from the rocket ship, which levels up by picking up the small power ups that appear randomly around the screen. As of yet, there 
is not a life system for the ship but that will be in the next set of updates.

## Game 2: Tic Tac Toe

This is a two player game where each player has a coloured cycle that is laid down on the board when they pick a square. Square selection is done by clicking the mouse 
anywhere in a free square. If a user selects a filled square, they will receive an alert. The game identifies victory as well as the tie state on completion of the game.
Further interactability, including players selecting the colour of their token, as well as the ability to reset or play again from the game panel will be in the
next update.

## Game 3: Ball Catch

This game requires the user to move the basket around the screen in an attempt to catch the randomly moving ball. Victory is signalled when the ball enters 
the basket while on a downward trajectory.

## Game 4: Reaction Test

This game is simply a user reaction test. A red square randomly moves around the screen and the user must click within it to win the game. It is set to be 
on a difficulty which requires the use of a mouse. Different difficulty levels will be introduced on the next update of this game.
